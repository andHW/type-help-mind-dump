## My Setup & Approach

- I used two monitors: one for the game, one for my VSCode to keep track of my notes.
- At some point, I realized that thunderclap events in the game signal a character's death. I started marking each death as it happened.
- I used the `find` command to search for "Thunderclap" in my notes and marked each death, noticing they occur sequentially from 11 down to 1.
- This helped me understand the story and brute-force most scenes, especially after the exciting part where Annie and John struggle before their deaths.
- I also marked an `X` once I realized all numbers (characters) are found in their appropriate scenes.
